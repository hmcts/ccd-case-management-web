$ yarn install

# (Optional) start the stub API
$ yarn stub-api

# start the development server
$ yarn start
```
go to [http://localhost:3451](http://localhost:3451) in your browser.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= v8.0.0
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are required:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| IDAM_LOGIN_URL | URL for IdAM's login web page. `https://idam.dev.ccidam.reform.hmcts.net/login` for the `dev` instance. |
| CCD_GATEWAY_BASE_URL | Base URL for CCD API gateway. `https://case-api-gateway-web.dev.ccd.reform.hmcts.net` for the `dev` instance. |
| CCD_ACTIVITY_BASE_URL | Base URL for CCD Case Activity service. `https://case-activity-api.dev.ccd.reform.hmcts.net/health` for the `dev` instance. |
| DM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL | Base URL for Document Management gateway. `https://api-gateway.dev.dm.reform.hmcts.net` for the `dev` instance. |

Environment variables:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| CCD_ACTIVITY_NEXT_POLL_REQUEST_MS | Frequency of activity requests. A good setting for it is the value of ACTIVITY_TTL_SEC in the activity service backend (avoid setting it lower than ACTIVITY_TTL_SEC) |
| CCD_ACTIVITY_RETRY | Number of attempts in case of unsuccessful calls to Activity service |
| CCD_ACTIVITY_MAX_REQUEST_PER_BATCH | Max number of cases activity requests batched in a single activity call. A good setting for it is the value of CCD_PAGE_SIZE |
| CCD_ACTIVITY_BATCH_COLLECTION_DELAY_MS | Max delay before a batch activity call is issued |

## Install dependencies

The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

To install dependencies please execute the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running

Simply run:

```
yarn start
```

to start the Case Management app on [http://localhost:3451](http://localhost:3451).

As an alternative, you can work using Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

* `yarn start:hmr`

And you are all set! You can now modify your components on the fly without having to reload the entire page.

### Docker

If you want your code to become available to other Docker projects (e.g. for local environment testing), you need to build the app and then the Docker image:

```bash
yarn build
docker-compose build
```

You can run it by executing following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

As a result, the Case Management app will be started and made available on port `3451`.

## Stubbing

To facilitate development, a stub of **CCD Aggregated API** can be used instead of a real instance.
The stub API can be started with:

* `yarn stub-api`

It will start a JSON-Server instance at `http://localhost:3453`, serving the content of the `stubs/aggregated.api.json` file.

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `yarn test`
* live mode (TDD style): `yarn test-watch`

### 2. Smoke & Functional Tests

See docs [here](https://github.com/hmcts/ccd-case-management-web/blob/master/test/README.md) 

              
## Production

To build your application, run:

* `yarn build`

You can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!

## Documentation.

You can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)) for your code with the following:

* `yarn docs`
