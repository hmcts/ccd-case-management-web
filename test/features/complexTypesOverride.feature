    Given I have logged in

  Scenario: limits the complex type using the EventToComplexTypes sheet
    Given a case type containing Complex and Collection types exists
    When I populate the form with the school data
    Then the 'Create school' page contains the following fields:
      | field                                                                             | value              | hidden |

      | MySchool.Class.1.ClassMembers.1.Children.1.AutisticChildCaseNumber.CaseReference  | 1111222233334444   | false  |

  Scenario: overrides the complex type data using the definition file EventToComplexTypes sheet
    Given a case type containing Complex and Collection types exists
    When I populate the form with the school data
    Then the fields should have label, hint text and displayContext updated
