    Given I have logged in
    And a case type containing show and hide functionality exists

  Scenario Outline: field on same page appears when hide and show condition is met
    Given I start createCase event
    And there is an '<fieldType>' field on page1
    And a conditional text field on the same page is hidden
    When I complete the show condition to show the field
    Then a conditional text field on the same page is displayed

    Examples:
      | fieldType       |
      | Mandatory text  |
      | Optional text   |

  Scenario Outline: field on same page hides when hide and show condition is not met
    Given I start createCase event
    And there is an '<fieldType>' field on page1 with a matching show condition
    And a conditional text field on the same page is displayed
    When I complete the show condition to hide the field
    Then a conditional text field on the same page is hidden

    Examples:
      | fieldType       |
      | Mandatory text  |
      | Optional text   |

  Scenario: field on the same page visible when show & hide condition is met based on the Readonly field

    When I start the event 'Approve a case'
    Then verify the field with label 'Text Field ShowHide 13' is visible
