Feature: Set of scenarios testing show & hide functionality using conditions based on fields in collections of complex

  Background:
    Given the following definition for 'complex case fields'
      | ID       | Path                                 | FieldType       | Field show condition                                                                                     |
      | MySchool | ProvidesAutisticChildrenSupport      | YesOrNo         |                                                                                                          |
      | MySchool | Family.Children.Child.IsAutistic     | YesOrNo         | MySchool.ProvidesAutisticChildrenSupport="Yes"                                                           |
      | MySchool | Family.Children.Child.NeedsSupport   | YesOrNo         | MySchool.ProvidesAutisticChildrenSupport="Yes" AND MySchool.Class.ClassMembers.Children.IsAutistic="Yes" |
    Given I have logged in

  Scenario: shows element when showCondition uses data from the element in a collection of complex on the same page
    Given a case type containing Complex and Collection types exists
    When I populate the form with the school data with a ClassMember IsAutistic field set to 'Yes'
    Then verify the field with label 'Does the child needs support?' is visible

  Scenario: hides element when showCondition uses data from the element in a collection of complex on the same page
    Given a case type containing Complex and Collection types exists
    When I populate the form with the school data with a ClassMember IsAutistic field set to 'No'
    Then verify the field with label 'Does the child needs support?' is not visible
